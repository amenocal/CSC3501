##Couple of programs done in the Computer Architecture class at LSU - CSC 3501

##Prog1: Basic bit-level operations
Does bit-level operations

##Prog2: Basic IA32 assembly and argumnet handling
Wrote a basic IA32 assembly routing using gnu assembly.
 - Return i1 + i2
 - sets **i3 = 5*(*i3)
 - writes the lower-case alphabet to string

##Prog3: Basic x87 Assembly and DGEMV
Wrote a basic x87 assembly routine using gnu assembly.
 - implments a matrix-vector multiplication for double precision.
